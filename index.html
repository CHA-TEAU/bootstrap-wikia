              was also considered to be beautiful; several of the bandits who attacked her and Clare in the forest
              commented lewdly that she was very attractive.

            <h5>Awakened Being</h5>
            <p>Teresa's awakened form is unusual compared to other awakened forms, as it is nearly identical to her
              human form. She sports two pairs of wings—a pair of larger ones arising from her upper back, and a pair of
              smaller ones at her lower back right above her buttocks. The wings are reminiscent of the traditional
              depiction of the twin goddesses Clare and Teresa. The other change is that the medial aspects of her
              thighs and legs have exposed muscles, the surrounding skin forming a scalloped edge. Galatea describes
              Teresa's awakened form, as seen under her "sight," as the very form of the twin goddesses. Teresa's
              awakened form was likely inspired by a Valkyrie.</p>

                    Noted first by <strong>Irene</strong>, Teresa's greatest strength is her outstanding technique to
                    sense Yoki so
                    acutely that she can detect the most minute changes in the Yoki flow of both Yoma and Warriors
                    alike, accurately predicting and counter their every move. This skill allows Teresa to judge the
                    strength, speed, and direction of an attack before her enemies can act. Irene concludes that
                    Teresa's adeptness in this area was the main reason why she was the top warrior of her
                    generation. <br>

                    As a trainee, Teresa was also able to track down Rafaela, who had completely erased her aura after
                    the incident with Luciela, in the woods, surprising Rafaela as she thought her yoki aura was
                    erased. <br>

                    Her sensory abilities are so advanced that she could predict exactly where to strike Priscilla,
                    despite the latter being faster than Hysteria's awakened form, so fast that she was virtually
                    invisible.

                    Teresa basically uses the standard sword technique. This version of an actually ordinary technique
                    can counter extraordinary or specialized techniques from other warriors. After relying on her sword
                    technique alone, she adapt, and overwhelmed Priscilla and the suppression squad. Other
                    powerful No. 1 warriors' standard sword skills are on significantly reduced levels. This shows the
                    huge difference between their overall abilities; for example, Roxanne mentions that Cassandra's
                    standard sword technique is only No. 5 level.[15] Warriors develop special techniques to enhanced
                    their fighting capability against powerful Yoma and awakened beings, which in Teresa's case, is not
                    necessary. Despite slightly injured by awakened Priscilla as she matched her speed, Teresa was able
                    to adapt and continued to shatter her body, although Priscilla grew stronger with each
                    regeneration. <br>

                    Similiar to Rafaela, Teresa casually used her legs to perform powerful kicks, which brings her
                    opponents at distance. <br>

                    Teresa is able to copying other warriors techniques, so she was able to use Cassandra's

                    other techniques, Clare has learned or witnessed before.
